      <p>We are not affiliated with a campaign or a political party. Our members really do cross the political spectrum. Formally, as a social welfare organization, IndivisibleMN03 will not: direct financial contributions or other support to a candidate, political party or PAC; make in-kind donations to a candidate, political party or PAC; nor make payments towards the administrative and fundraising costs of a political organization. IndivisibleMN03 does not cooperate with, consult with, or receive requests for information from candidates or political parties. We will not share participant information (telephone, email or mailing address) with any candidate, political party, or any other entity. We do intend to endorse candidates for the 2018 general election.</p>
      <p>Throughout our district, neighborhood groups also inspired by the Indivisible Guide have sprung up. While we share the same set of federal representatives, these groups function independently from Indivisible MN03. We promote their meetings and events as is feasible. These affiliate groups may be making endorsements as per their rules â€“ that is a separate process from us as we are separate organizations.</p>
